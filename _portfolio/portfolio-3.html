title: "An evaluation of heart rate monitoring with in-ear earphones under motion "
collection: portfolio
---
1) Five photoplethysmography (PPG)-based wearable heart rate monitors and ECG sensors were used to compare heart rate 
during each phase of exercise and rest with a gold-standard electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor.
2) Exercise physiology instruments were used to assist in measuring the experimenter's motor performance and detecting abnormalities.
3) Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The validity of the in-ear pulse rate measurement devices was determined 
by means of several statistical tests. Accuracy was tested by MAPE and ICC values, whereas precision was identified by the limits of agreement of the Bland–Altman analysis.
