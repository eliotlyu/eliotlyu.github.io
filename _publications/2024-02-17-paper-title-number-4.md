ABSTRACT:
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Exercise Snack-type Resistance Training on changes in Body Composition, Muscle Strength(1RM-leg pressure, 1RM-45oC seated row), blood variables (TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C), hs-CRP, and Cortisol levels in men in their 20s. To conduct 
this study, 10 males in their 20s with a BMI of 25kg/m2 or more and a Body fat (%) of 25% or more, who had no special medical condition and 
met the obesity standard, were selected. The selected 10 subjects performed basic tests such as body composition test and maximum strength test in thesame way as before and after.
Ten subjects were randomly assigned to the Exercise Snack Resistance Training Group (ESG) and Resistance Training (RTG), trained three times aweek for eight weeks, the Resistance Training Group performed an hour-long program per day, and ESG performed a total of four programs at one-
hour intervals per day.
The results of this study are as follows. After 8 weeks of exercise trained, Body Weight, Body Fat percentage, and BMI did not decrease 
significantly after training in ESG and RTG. The defibrillation amount was significantly reduced after training in RTG (p<.05). Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced after training in RTG (p<.05). Systolic blood pressure showed a significant decrease after training in ESG (p<.05). Blood TG,TC, andLDL-C did not show any significant difference in ESG and RTG after training. HDL-C showed a significant increase after training in RTG (p<.05). There was no significant difference in blood hs-CRP and Cortisol) between ESG and RTG. 1RM-Leg press was significantly increased after 
training in RTG (p<.01). 1RM-Seated Row showed a significant increase after training in ESG (p<.05). Putting the results of this study together, the 8-weeks Exercisesnacks resistance Training significantly showed a decrease in blood pressure and an increase in muscle strength in adult obese men, and the muscle strength was improved through the training effect. It is believed that resistance training in the form of Exercise Snack will improve muscle strength and reduce the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in obese adult men. In future studies, it is considered that different researchers are needed for the Exercise Snack's training type, intensity and duration.
